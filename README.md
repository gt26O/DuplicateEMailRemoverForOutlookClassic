# Duplicate Email Remover for Outlook (Classic)

## Overview
**Duplicate Email Remover for Outlook Classic** is a Windows Forms application that connects to Microsoft Office Outlook (Classic) and scans the user's mailboxes and PST files for duplicate emails. The application provides multiple options for handling duplicates, including deletion, moving, copying, logging, and exporting. The software was created in November 2023 and updated in December 2024.

## Key Features
- **Folder Selection**: Users can choose specific folders or mailboxes to scan for duplicates.

- **Customizable Folder Order**: Adjust the processing order of folders to control where duplicates are removed.

- **Advanced Matching Options**: Match duplicates based on fields like date, sender, subject, body, and attachments.
- **Backup Capability**: Save duplicates to a specified Windows file folder for backup.
- **Compatibility**: Designed for Outlook Classic and does not support the "New Outlook" version.

## Delete with Backup, Audit List, and Restore

The tool now treats deletion as a safe, reversible, fully audited operation:

- **Works directly in Outlook Classic** through COM automation, including
  **Exchange / Office 365** accounts. Deletions made here go to *Deleted Items*
  and sync to the server like any other Outlook change (cached-mode accounts
  recommended for speed on very large mailboxes).
- **Live progress with detail.** The *Go* tab shows the current folder,
  elapsed time, processing **rate**, an **ETA**, running counts, and a live list
  of the emails being deleted.
- **Every deleted email is backed up first.** Before an email is deleted it is
  exported to its own `.msg` file in a timestamped backup folder
  (`Documents\DuplicateEmailRemover\Backup_<date>` by default, or the folder you
  pick). If the backup fails, the email is **not** deleted.
- **An audit list with a unique id.** Each backup folder contains
  `DeletedEmails.csv` and `DeletedEmails.json` listing every deleted email with a
  unique id, subject, sender, dates, size, hash, original folder, and backup
  file.
- **One-click restore.** The **"Restore deleted emails…"** button opens a window
  that loads a manifest, lists the deleted emails, and puts any selected ones
  back into Outlook — into their original folder (or the Inbox if that folder no
  longer exists). Restore reads the `.msg` backups, so it works even on Exchange
  where item ids change over time.

### Restoring later

1. On the *Go* tab click **Restore deleted emails…**.
2. Open the `DeletedEmails.json` file inside the backup folder.
3. Check the emails to restore and click **Restore checked** (or **Restore all
   pending**). The manifest is updated to mark what has been restored.

## Reliability Improvements

Recent changes make the tool safer and more dependable on large mailboxes and
PST files (tens of GB):

- **Fixed "Move to folder".** A copy/paste bug left the destination unset when
  *Move* was selected, causing an error; it now works.
- **No more skipped duplicates.** Delete/Move/Copy actions are collected during
  the scan and applied afterwards (re-fetching each email by its `EntryID`),
  instead of being applied while enumerating a folder — which silently skipped
  items in Outlook COM and required several passes.
- **Lower memory use.** COM objects (emails, attachments, folder item
  collections) are now released as the scan proceeds, avoiding leaks that could
  crash long runs over very large PST files.
- **Safe cancellation.** Pressing *Stop* now aborts cleanly: queued
  delete/move/copy actions are **not** applied, so nothing is changed.
- **No cross-thread UI access.** All settings are captured once on the UI thread
  before the background scan starts.

> Tip for a 30 GB PST: **back up the .pst first**, run once in *Log only* mode to
> review the report, and process folders in batches.

## Project Layout & Tests

The duplicate-detection logic lives in a small, Outlook-free library so it can be
unit tested on any platform:

- `DuplicateEMailRemoverForOutlookClassic.csproj` — the WinForms app (net8.0-windows,
  Outlook COM). Built in Visual Studio on Windows.
- `Core/` (`DuplicateEMailRemover.Core`, net8.0) — `IMailItem`, `MatchOptions`,
  `DuplicateKeyBuilder`, `DuplicateClassifier`, and the deleted-email manifest.
  No Outlook/Windows dependency.
- `Tests/` (`DuplicateEMailRemover.Core.Tests`, xUnit) — tests for the matching
  key, the first-wins duplicate classification, and the manifest CSV/JSON.

Run the tests (no Outlook needed):

```bash
dotnet test Tests/DuplicateEMailRemover.Core.Tests.csproj
```

Continuous integration builds the Core library and runs these tests on every push
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The WinForms app itself is compiled on Windows.

## System Requirements

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Select Folders**
   - Start with the "Select Folders" tab to choose which mailboxes and folders to scan.
   - Right-click on a folder to include all its subfolders.

     - Move to a specified folder.
     - Copy to a specified folder.
     - Open each email in Outlook.
     - Delete duplicates.
     - Log duplicates to a file only.
   - Optionally save each duplicate to a Windows file folder.
   - Choose matching criteria from fields like `DateTime Sent`, `Sender Address`, `Subject`, etc.

4. **Accept Terms**
   - Read and accept the license agreement and warnings on the "Accept" tab.

5. **Start Processing**
   - Click "Start" on the "Go" tab to begin scanning and handling duplicates.
   - View the status of folders and duplicates in real-time.
   - A log file of actions taken will open automatically upon completion.

## ChatGPT/AI Usage
As of 12/22/2024, all source code in this project was created entirely by Ryan Scott White without the assistance of AI tools. This project originated in November 2023, during a period when Ryan relied solely on traditional IT resources. However, this README.md file was crafted with the help of ChatGPT-4 on 12/21/2024.

## Note Regarding Co-Pilot
Microsoft currently does not recognize me as an "open source contributor," so I have not had access to their $10/month CoPilot service. I did have the opportunity to use CoPilot for a year in 2021/2022, during its pre-release phase when it was offered for free to all users. I often wonder whether my 20+ original projects, publicly available on GitHub, contributed to training the AI. Given this body of work, I feel I should be acknowledged as an open source contributor.
